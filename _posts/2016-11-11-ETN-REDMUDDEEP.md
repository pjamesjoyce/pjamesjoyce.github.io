## Why?

I like to think in pictures. When I start an LCA, the first step is to draw a flow diagram showing the major processes involved, the flows between them and the inputs and outputs associated with each step.

For my PhD project, working with chemical engineers and metallurgists all across the EU, I thought it might be a good idea to engage them with the LCA process through drawing these flow charts, and seeing the potential impact of their processes, instantly and interactively.

So, after teaching myself Django, some CSS and some javascript tricks - ETN-REDMUD:DEEP (Data Entry and Exploration Platform) was born.

It's still in its infancy, but the video below outlines it's basic use.
